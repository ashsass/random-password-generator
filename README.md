## Post Project Thoughts
- Need more repeititon with certain concepts so I can execute quicker. 
- Styling can take up a lot of my time and CSS can be very tricky. I want to continue learning best practices with CSS
- I really enjoyed this project. I was really able to see my hard work pay off with the JavaScript lessons.
