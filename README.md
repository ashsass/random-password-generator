# Random Number Generator
## A Solo Project from Scrimba
This project is to create a website that allows user to configure a password.

### Requirements
- Build it from "scratch"
- Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button
- Each password should be 15 characters long 

### Extra Credit
- Set a password length
- Add "copy-on-click"
- Toggle symbols and numbers on/off
- Make a nicer alert to the user (my addition)

## Post Project Thoughts
- Need more repeititon with certain concepts so I can execute quicker. 
- Styling can take up a lot of my time and CSS can be very tricky. I want to continue learning best practices with CSS
- I really enjoyed this project. I was really able to see my hard work pay off with the JavaScript lessons. 
- setTimeout is my best friend. 
- Restyle the input box and the checkboxes 
- Change the color of the button and the mouse on hover
