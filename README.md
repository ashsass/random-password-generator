# Random Number Generator
## A Solo Project from Scrimba
This project is to create a website that allows user to configure a password.

### Requirements
- Build it from "scratch"
- Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button
- Each password should be 15 characters long 

### Extra Credit
- Set a password length
- Add "copy-on-click"
- Toggle symbols and numbers on/off
- Make a nicer alert to the user (my addition)
